# Qualitative Analysis of Identified Risks

## Risk List

### 1. Data Privacy Breach

- **Probability**: P3
- **Severity**: S3
- **Risk Level**: Not that common but should be dealt with because sensitive student/teacher information.

### 2. Technical Reliability Concerns

- **Probability**: P4 (Likely)
- **Severity**: S2 (Marginal)
- **Risk Level**: Likely because a the program will have a lot of users but not that harmful since it only causes slowdowns.

### 3. Accessibility and Usability Problems

- **Probability**: P4 (Likely)
- **Severity**: S1 (Negligible)
- **Risk Level**: Acceptable but should be addressed to ensure inclusive.

### 4. Content Quality Issues

- **Probability**: P3 (Possible)
- **Severity**: S2 (Marginal)
- **Risk Level**: Acceptable with human oversight of AI-generated content.

### 5. Authentication Failures

- **Probability**: P3 (Possible)
- **Severity**: S2 (Marginal)
- **Risk Level**: Acceptable with multiple authentication methods and monitoring.

### 6. Performance Degradation

- **Probability**: P5 (Certain)
- **Severity**: S1 (Negligible)
- **Risk Level**: Acceptable with proper capacity planning and performance optimization.

### 7. Algorithmic Bias

- **Probability**: P3 (Possible)
- **Severity**: S2 (Marginal)
- **Risk Level**: Acceptable with diverse training data and regular bias audits.

### 8. Administrative Control Problems

- **Probability**: P3 (Possible)
- **Severity**: S1 (Negligible)
- **Risk Level**: Acceptable with proper training and user-centered design.

### Risk Matrix

| Probability  | S1: Negligible | S2: Marginal | S3: Critical | S4: Catastrophic |
| ------------ | -------------- | ------------ | ------------ | ---------------- |

## Risk Management Plan for EduCards

### High Priority Risks

#### 1. Data Privacy Breach (P3, S3)

- Implement end-to-end encryption for all personal data storage and transmission
- Establish role-based access controls with principle of least privilege
- Number of unauthorized access attempts

### Medium Priority Risks

#### 2. Technical Reliability Concerns (P4, S2)

- Implement redundant server architecture
- Implement database integrity checks and validation
- Establish manual quiz administration procedures as fallback
- Deploy automated recovery procedures for database issues
- System up-time percentage

#### 4. Content Quality Issues (P3, S2)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
