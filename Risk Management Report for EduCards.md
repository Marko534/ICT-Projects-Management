## Qualitative Analysis of Identified Risks

### Risk List

#### 1. Data Privacy Breach

- **Probability**: P3
- **Severity**: S3
- **Risk Level**: Not that common but should be dealt with because sensitive student/teacher information.

#### 2. Technical Reliability Concerns

- **Probability**: P4 (Likely)
- **Severity**: S2 (Marginal)
- **Risk Level**: Likely because a the program will have a lot of users but not that harmful since it only causes slowdowns.  

#### 3. Accessibility and Usability Problems

- **Probability**: P4 (Likely)
- **Severity**: S1 (Negligible)
- **Risk Level**: Acceptable but should be addressed to ensure inclusive.

#### 4. Content Quality Issues

- **Probability**: P3 (Possible)
- **Severity**: S2 (Marginal)
- **Risk Level**: Acceptable with human oversight of AI-generated content.

#### 5. Authentication Failures

- **Probability**: P3 (Possible)
- **Severity**: S2 (Marginal)
- **Risk Level**: Acceptable with multiple authentication methods and monitoring.

#### 6. Performance Degradation

- **Probability**: P5 (Certain)
- **Severity**: S1 (Negligible)
- **Risk Level**: Acceptable with proper capacity planning and performance optimization.

#### 7. Algorithmic Bias

- **Probability**: P3 (Possible)
- **Severity**: S2 (Marginal)
- **Risk Level**: Acceptable with diverse training data and regular bias audits.

#### 8. Administrative Control Problems

- **Probability**: P3 (Possible)
- **Severity**: S1 (Negligible)
- **Risk Level**: Acceptable with proper training and user-centered design.

### Risk Matrix

| Probability  | S1: Negligible | S2: Marginal | S3: Critical | S4: Catastrophic |
| ------------ | -------------- | ------------ | ------------ | ---------------- |
